 *
 * API to retrieve event's from the backend SDL library. Events are the movement
 * of the mouse and keypresses. Mouse coordinates are exposed through
 * @ref xGetMouseX and @ref xGetMouseY while keypress events are received by
 * retriving the most recent copy of the button status lookup table exposed
 * through the FreeRTOS queue @ref inputQueue.
 *
 * @ref inputQueue holds a single array of unsigned chars of the length
 * SDL_NUM_SCANCODES. The scancodes that are defind in the SDL header
 * SDL_scancode.h are used as the indicies when accessing the stored data in
 * the table.
